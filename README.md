# Hospital Management Data Analysis Project

## Project Background
Efficient hospital management not only require high-quality medical care but also optimized administrative and financial operations. Hospitals often deal with frequent patient cancellations, no-shows, and also insurance claim denials which affects revenue. In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of hospital management data to deliver key insights and recommendations on how the hospital administration can improve operational efficiency. Key KPIs

## Analysis Summary


## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
### Operational KPIs
- Appointment Cancellation Rate- % of scheduled appointments that patients canceled or missed
- Patient Flow- measures how busy the hospital is throughout the week and months
- Appointments by Doctor and Specialization- measures how busy different doctors and specializations are when compared with one another

### Financial KPIs
- Claim Denial Rate- % of insurance claims that are denied
- Revenue by Doctor and Specialization- measures financial performance across doctors and specialization
- Payment Method- tracks the % of patients that pay with different methods (insurance, credit card, cash)

### Patient Demographics KPIs
- Age Distribution of Patients- helps understand the population is served
- Total Patients- how many patients were served throughout the year

## Insights Deep-Dive
### Appointments Dashboard
*Looking at how busy the hospital is throughout the year and % of patients that show up to their appointment*



## Limitations
- The dataset is synthetic as hospital management data is often kept confidential due to HIPPA
- Data is only given in 2023 so it is difficult to make conclusions on trends
- There are only 200 rows in the dataset so making statistically significant conclusions are difficult
